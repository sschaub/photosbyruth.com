	<h3>When should I contact you about doing a newborn photo shoot? </h3>
    <p>As soon as your bundle of joy arrives! Seriously. The best newborn photos are taken when your baby is no more than two weeks old - when he/she is still sleeping a lot, still curling up in the fetal position and not dealing with baby acne yet. I have shot babies a little older than that, but the sessions tend to be quite challenging as the baby wants to be awake longer and is moving around more, but is not strong enough to hold his head up. So please call me early!</p>

    <h3>What should the baby and I wear at the photo shoot?</h3>
    <p>You should plan on wearing a solid color shirt and skirt/pants, and I recommend darker colors, as they tend to be more slimming than lighter colors. The baby's skin fits it better than any clothes you have for it, so I generally take pictures of the baby in nothing but a diaper and any diaper cover or pants/panties you have. If you have a special outfit you want the baby to wear, we can try some pictures with the outfit, but most of the time, the outfit doesn't fit well, and ends up not showing very well.</p>
    
    <h3>Should I bring anything else?</h3>
    <p>If you have a special blanket or stuffed animal, a fun hat or prop, do bring it and we'll try to incorporate that into the pictures.</p>
    
    <h3>Where do you do your photo shoots?</h3>
    <p> I have a large picture window in my dining room that provides nice soft light from God's wonderful light source. But this means that I can shoot only at certain times. I shoot in the afternoon (1:30 or 2:00 to 3:00 or 4:00), and I must have a mostly sunny day to get enough light for the photo shoot.</p>
    
    <h3>How long is a typical photo session?</h3>
    <p>I allow 2 to 3 hours to shoot a newborn. This allows time for baby to be fed, changed, and cuddled. Since the baby will be in an unfamiliar environment, he may be a little
          restless and less inclined to sleep. If it is possible, keep him awake in the hours preceding the shoot. Feel free to wait until you get to my home to feed the baby.</p>
    
    <h3>Do you take pictures of older kids or families?</h3>
    <p>Yes, I do, and I have occasionally met folks at area parks for some fun photo shoots. Get in touch with me and I'll see what I can work out.</p>
    
    <h3>How much do you charge?</h3>
    <p>I view my photo shoots as a fun hobby that provides a ministry to my church family and close friends, so I don't charge as much as the average photographer. I am also a full-time home schooling mom of five delightful children, so I have to set a limit on how often I schedule shoots. Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> for a quote.</p>
    
    <h3>What is included in the cost?</h3>
    <p> I give you a cd of edited pictures, as well as access to a Picasa web album for a limited time to share with family and friends. You are free to do what you like with the pictures - print the size you want, create a scrapbook, publish a photo album. Some of my clients have been quite creative in what they have done with the pictures! If you would like me to create a custom greeting card or announcement with one of the pictures, please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> and I'll see what we can work out.</p>
